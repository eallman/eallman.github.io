{\bf \centerline{{\large Lab 2: Throwing dice}}}

\centerline{due date: Friday, September 22 in class}

\bigskip

\subsection*{Introduction}

This week you will complete a short R lab that involves rolling dice and computing sums,
and tossing coins.  Again and again and again.  This is why we use R.  Each question
is worth 5 points.

You will be graded both on correctness of your answers and on the presentation of
your answer.  This means you need to \emph{explain} your methodology well.

A list of useful R commands is included as the last page of this handout.  You will
need to modify the commands to your purposes.  A copy of this file is available
on the class webpage, if you want to use something like WORD for your write up, 
or to cut and paste commands.

\subsection*{Problems}

\begin{enumerate}

\item In this problem, you will explore the sum of the roll of three dice.
For sample sizes, try $n = 10, 25, 50, 100$ or other values $n$ of your choice.
Suppose you roll the three dice and sum the outcomes repeatedly.  If you
were to earn a \$1 for the sum, for instance, then a roll of 1,1,1 earns you
\$3. 

How much do you expect to earn in an average game?
Carefully, explain your answer and methodology below.

\newpage

\item You toss a \emph{biased} coin repeatedly, with the probability of
heads, $P (H) = p$, for some unknown value of $p$.  Your goal is to
give the best estimate of $p$ that you can.  To that end, suppose
that you earn \$1 each time a H comes up, and \$10 each time a T
comes up.

There are 4 data sets available for you.  They are called
\emph{earningsSampleSizeN} where $N = 10, 100, 1000, 10000$.
Again, your task is to give the best estimate for $p$ you can give from
these datasets and explain how you arrived at your answer.

I estimate the value of $p$ to be \underline{\hskip 2cm}.
