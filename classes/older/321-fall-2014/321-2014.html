<strong>Modified instructions:</strong>
 Prime factorizations of integers are of paramount
 importance in modern computer security algorithms as we will
 see. This project is about analyzing the patterns of factorizations
 of numbers of a special type.

 Consider the numbers of the form a_n=1+2^n where n is a
 nonnegative integer. So a_0=2, a_1=3, a_2=5, a_3=9, etc.

 Write a program, (a for loop will suffice), that will compute the prime
 factorizations of a_n for many values of n. <br /><br />

 * Make conjectures about for which values of n the numbers a_n are
 composite.<br />

 * Try to find patterns of a_n divisible by certain specific
 divisors. See if you can justify any of these patterns.<br /><br />

 Hand in your program, output of your program,
 and answers to the two questions with asterisks.<br /><br />

2. Write a program in PARI/GP that prints all prime numbers between 1 and 100.
Hand in ONLY the code that executes this program.
