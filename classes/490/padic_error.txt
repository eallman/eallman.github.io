p-dic Analysis Compared with Real, S. Katok


p 38, problem 40: The first inequality should be strict. 

p 81: 'd' is missing from 'Hadamard'

p 90: Near the bottom of the page, the formula for ord_p(a_n) has an extra n in the denominator

p 92: In the 2 offset equations at the top of the page, the 'ord_2' should be deleted (or the wording revised).



Answers, Hints and solutions:
****In the hint to problem 11(4) (which is called part (3) there) something is messed up. The notation ||a_n|| appears in the hint, while it doesn't in the problem. There are 2 interpretations to 'fix' this:

1) Interpret the ||a_n|| in the hint as |a_n|, which means that you are only working with a sequence of real numbers using the Euclidean norm. This is consistent with the statement of the problem, where the inequalities 'a_n<-c' and 'a_n>c' can only make sense if a_n is real, since > and < are not defined in an arbitrary normed field.

2) Don't change the hint, but change the problem  by replacing 'a_n<-c or a_n>c' with '||a_n||>c'. The problem now applies to any normed field.

Note the second version is the result that is needed on p. 16 of the text. 

**** The hint to problem 16 is garbled a bit.

**** The hint to problem 20 suggests doing more than is stated in the problem

**** The hint for problem 33 is missing an 'a' in the last formula for 'r'.

**** In the hint for problem 80, the series for sine and cosine should have
(-1)^n rather than (-1)n.
