      <h3> National Park road trip 2022</h3>
      <strong>Month 1: </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaving Fairbanks, off through Canada, and back into the US. 
     </div>

  </p>

Friends and Family (hereafter known solely as friends):  &nbsp;&nbsp; As many of you know, our plan
for fall 2022 has been to take a long circuitious route through US National Parks on our
way to New Hampshire.  It is sabbatical year, and Katherine will be home schooling with
Dad in the fall (Mom would drive her crazy), and at seventh grade in New Hampshire in the spring.

We have been planning this for years, and after many a bump in the road before leaving (COVID,
Zara illness) we finally left Fairbanks on September 1.  We actually left our house on August
19th, but there were so many things to take care of, not the least of which was an emergency
trip from Denali NP to Fairbanks for Zara (she is fine now) that we finally left the state on
the first of September.

      Before our departure, my mind held opposing emotions:  excitement at the prospect of our
      imminent departure for a long-anticipated adventure, but also a sadness at leaving behind
      things that I love about Alaska ---friends, Katherine's friends and families,
      the boreal forest, the Equinox, a satisfying daily rhythm, my skis, our house, etc.
      Not since college have I left my home for one year's duration.

 	Indeed, with these thoughts in mind I thought I would try to write occasional
	letters to you all to keep in touch as we explore the lower 48.  My brother
	too asked for a map with destinations, so that he and his wife could keep
	track of us.  It will be easier to write one note, so please excuse the mass
	mailing.

  Our itinerary in a nutshell has been Denali NP (gotta start with the best!), through Canada
  along the Cassiar, crossing the border at Abbotsford, then North Cascades NP, Mt. Rainier
  NP, and now Olympic NP.  The weather has been truly magnificent, with smoke in North Cascades,
  but other than that picture-perfect.
  For Rich (brother), check out our route to the right.  I am writing this from Olympic NP,
  where we hope to stay for many days, decreasing the amount of driving at last.  Yesterday 
  we had a wonderful visit with a long-time friend from Maine who treated us
  to a lovely dinner in Tacoma, before heading out again.  I hope we get to see
  some of you too.  COVID has certainly made us rethink the important things in life,
  and having good friends and adventures is high on the list.

    The highlights for the first weeks for sure were BEARS!  BEARS!  BEARS! everywhere!
    Grizzlies in Denali NP (late August) and black bears and grizzlies in Canada.  At
    a campground in Canada, Meziadan Lake, as we were selecting a site, a grizzly
    walked through our first choice.  Then it hung out in the bushes near our second choice campsite,
    walked by several times, and was generally a bit reluctant to leave even as the
    campground hosts chased it in a truck and whooped at it.  Gotta love a campground
    when there are so many bears around (and you are safe in a camper).

     Katherine's favorite stop so far was Boya Lake on the Cassiar.  It was a gorgeous spot, and we rented a kayak
     and canoe to paddle around.  For me, I think Mt. Rainier has been the highlight, likely soon to be overtaken by
     Olympic NP.  The smoke around the North Cascades did not obscure the view too much, and the sun glowed orange
     as it set.  In one of the photos below, taken in Hope, BC (where we thought about Katherine's good friend), you can see
     a helicopter dropping water on a wildfire.  The campsite at Mt. Rainier was in old growth forest, and
     the lush feeling of the hundreds-year-old trees is calming and magnificent.  Katherine counted some
     rings on one downed trunk and we were reminded of her toddler counting:  &quot;One. Two. Three.
     A lot!&quot.  The volcano (Mt. Rainier) was hidden for the majority of      two days and then on our
     last afternoon there, as we started our hike, it came out.  And stayed out.  Just breathtaking.

     <br />
     As you can see, I am running out of steam so will let the photos tell the story.  Best wishes to all for
     the start of the school year, or for the start of the autumn.  Keep in touch. &nbsp; ---
     Elizabeth
