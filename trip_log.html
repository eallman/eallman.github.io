 <strong>Last installment: </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
 December 19, 2022. &nbsp;&nbsp;


 Since I wimped out last month and only sent a Thanksgiving greeting to my family,
 this last installment of the trip blog must cover months 3 and 4.  It's
 hard to do so even so shortly after ending our travels, since we are now safely in New Hampshire
 and my mind is moving on to other things.  I'll try to highlight a few
 happenings that are most interesting, since I am sure when I next see many
 of you these thoughts and emotions will be long past.  No Christmas card this year;
 these ramblings will have to suffice.
 <p><p>
   For starters, and for Rich in particular, I include the three maps
   of our recent travels.

   <td style="border-top: none">  Leaving out stopovers, the itinerary in a nutshell was:
     Yosemite National Park, Kings Canyon NP, Sequoia NP, Calico Ghost Town park, Death Valley NP,
     Valley of Fire State Park, Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon NP, Grand Canyon NP, Homolovi park,
     Petrified Forest NP, Montezuma Castle NM,
     Saguaro NP, Kartchner Caverns SP, Oliver Lee SP, White Sands NM, Valley of Fires SP, Roswell,
     Thanksgiving in truly miserable weather (horizontal rain and snow, high winds) at Brantley Lakes SP,
     Guadalupe Mts NP, Carlsbad Caverns NP, El Paso, Ciudad Juarez, Big Bend NP, Lost Alaskan RV park
     for Katherine's birthday (!), and then ...... lots of time in San Angelo, TX before heading home
     to New Hampshire.

     </td>
  </table>

  Katherine who wrote a truly hilarious and tender weekly trip log
  for her 7th grade class in New Hampshire reported the following statistic: we visited 37
  parks and monuments.

  To this I can add that we ate lots of DQ blizzards and pints of ice cream,
  and we traveled 12,368 miles since leaving Alaska and
  13,087 miles if you add our time in Denali and out Chena Hot Spring Road too.
  I drove a total of <em>zero</em> of these miles.  I was voted down as a relief
  driver since I am completely ignorant of my purported propensity to use the
  accelerator like a pump or for good exercise for my calves and foot ;-).
  Never had a day of car sickness (or any kind of motion sickness for that matter)
  in my life,
  but I do seem to be able to induce it rather easily in others, or so I'm told.
 <p><p>
   No trip log would be complete without my mentioning our time in Yosemite.  It
   must have been my tenth time there, and I still love it.  John finds the valley
   too busy, and he's right, but somehow all that traffic still can't ruin for
   me the sheer awe I feel every time I look at the towering stone walls.  In graduate
   school, where I visited Yosemite on the order of 5-6 times, I used to blast
   the last movement of Beethoven's Ninth symphony as I drove up the mountains
   from the south.  The combination of gorgeous scenery, winding roads, darkness
   because I almost always drove into Yosemite in the dark, and "O Freunde!" blasting
   at ear-damaging decibel levels in a beater of an automobile is a memory I cherish.
   It's one of those things
   I have done in life that made me incredibly happy and simply in love with life.
   No loud classical music on the approach this time (would have been vetoed if I even suggested it), but
   the same sense of majesty overcame me.
 <p>
   Katherine really loved `El Cap' (why do you call it that, Mom?) and in particular
   seeing climbers who had spent the night on their port-a-ledges.  Colorful to look
   at, but my definition of crazy, despite knowing at least one person who has spent
   such a night.  I really loved our hike up to Vernal falls and reliving my grad school
   experience of a lightening storm coming in as we summited Half Dome.  (Okay, I didn't love the
   part about the thunder and lightening.)  But Half Dome is such an amazing sight,
   defying expectation of what a mountain is supposed to look like.

   After Yosemite, we headed to King's Canyon and Sequoia national parks.  It got a bit
   cold, but not too cold, and we still got to enjoy the incredible Sierra,  Katherine
   enjoyed the tall trees and stories like how in the 30s, folks chopped down a Sequoia
   that required 18 people with arms spread to encircle its girth.  They chopped it down, cut it to pieces,
   put it on a train, reconstructed it in Chicago for a world's fair, and then everyone
      thought it was a hoax (!)
 <p><p>
   Death Valley was hot and dry and beautiful.  Perhaps my favorite pictures from the trip
   were taken there.  It was colorful and the soft light again added so much atmosphere.
   Below I included a picture of John and Katherine walking in the salt of badwater.  It's
   a view I saw so often on this trip.  Two peas in a pod, with me faithfully following
   (not unlike a dog).
   


   Halloween was spent in Zion.  I am not sure if it was the late autumn season with its
   low, soft light or something else, but it was more beautiful than I remembered it.  Bryce Canyon too,
   which had fresh snow on its hoodoos.
   Zion was the first place that we saw hints of leaves changing color.  Fast forward a few parks
   and I'll mention that Katherine really liked seeing petroglyphs and the pueblos of the southwest.
   We all particularly liked the caverns we visited, with Kartchner Caverns (state park in AZ) maybe
   the best of them all.  Carlsbad was a close competitor, but both were amazing.

    Saguaro National Park was really a treat, and quite a surprise.  The saguaros (as Katherine says,
    `the classic cactus') grow all over and come in very interesting shapes.  I thought that they
    perhaps deserved the name `Joshua tree' more than the namesakes, as so many of them do look like
    Joshua praying.  And running it seems.

   White Sands is, well, weird.  The `sledding' is slooo-ow, and it's not cold out.  We did
   get to see the nearby `World's largest pistachio' though, and weird street lights in Roswell.
   Then a very interesting day in Juarez.  Our former PhD student from Mexico was stunned that
   we went there .... cartels, gangs, etc, but we read it was now safe in the tourist areas.  Things were for
   sale everywhere, with street peddlers and beggars entreating us to buy or donate something.
   It was incredibly easy to walk into Mexico, you just pay a fee and walk over a bridge, no
   passport check.  In contrast, there was a long, long line to get back into the US.
   We watched a funeral from outside the main cathedral and talked to the hearse driver
   who was going to drive the body 5 hours to its burial site.  Our experience in the southwest
   shed some light on the intractable problem of border control, but not enough to explain
   the politics of the leaders in AZ and TX.

	  Still lots to say, but I'm winding down on the photo editing and there are two important
stories to tell once the photos are finished.  Guadalupe Mountains and Big Bend national parks
are spectacular.  Thanksgiving in torrential rain/snow/sleet and high wind meant that Carlsbad
Caverns closed for two days, and Guadalupe mountains was telling visitors not to hike up to the ridge.  (Kristen:
up there with the White Mts. ;-)  Worse on the ridge. )   We had to stay put to outlast the storm, but got to visit
Guadalupe mountains with snow on the ground.  Big Bend and the Rio Grande, were also special.
Great hiking, hot springs, dark star-studded skies, lovely campground, historic buildings, etc.
I'd love to return there some time.  
 <p><p>
   Our last stop before starting the drive to New Hampshire was  Lost Alaskan RV park, chosen
   by Katherine to celebrate her 13th birthday.  Good name, good wifi, good showers, good location, supposedly
   a good pool.  It was super relaxing, and Dec 4 was a very special day!

	      There are several commentaries I had thought I'd write about, but have not taken the time to do so.   One
	      important/interesting one is that as far as we can tell, outside of Navajo Nation in eastern Arizona,
	      no one in this country thinks that COVID is a concern.  Pretty much no one wore masks (except in NN
	      where they were required).  We skipped big cities for the most part because of hauling a camper trailer,
	      so maybe it's different in cities, but it was quite a change from the last years.  It was as if the
	      worries of COVID never existed.  Since we all had COVID in July, I felt (perhaps foolishly) somewhat
	      safe and was not concerned, but it was eye-opening to see.  And liberating.  COVID robbed us of
	      so much, and it has been wonderful to travel again and see folks in action.
<p><p>
Though it might seem as if our trip was all fun, that would not be true.  We did get  a decent amount of work done, and
really enjoyed our two day sojourns in RV parks where we had good wifi for Zoom meetings.  Katherine's schooling
went overall pretty well:  lots of math, and a fair amount of reading, science and writing (and complaining).  I think that the home
schooling was a bit hard on John in the sense that it diminished his time to work.  None of us grew tired of life in a
camper, and indeed I was sad to return to a bed in a hotel on the drive home.  I love the smell of fresh air
through the windows while I sleep, and the coziness of my sleeping bag.  A tiny shower is manageable, and cooking
is easy once you get used to only having two burners.  Solar panels made for a constant electricity supply.
In the end I think we all agree that four months in a camper has been a great experience, not in small part
because this country is so beautiful.  Katherine made an insightful comment about living in close quarters that I 
will pass along, `If we are living in a cramped space like this and we get along 95% of the time, that's
success.'
<p>
The least enjoyable part of our trip started the day after Katherine's birthday.  We left Alpine, TX on Monday, Dec 5
with the intent of driving a lot of miles in the next days.  The plan was to get Katherine to New Hampshire to go
with her 7th grade class on a field trip.  It would give her the chance to meet her future classmates, and 
to socialize with someone under the age of 50.  At Katherine's suggestion, we would drive to Selma and Birmingham 
to visit some civil rights historic sites, breaking up the long drive home.  
<p>
The day started out well enough, but in rural
ranch-land TX, east of El Dorado if you want to look it up on a map, we hit a deer.  Maybe you noticed the deer
on the third map up above?  It's located where we hit the deer.  In addition to the shock and horror of hitting a deer
(which we think lived as it bounded away over a 3 foot fence), after picking up grill pieces in the road
we watched the last of our radiator fluid drain out, and there was no cell service.  After about 4 hours, with
the help of a very nice retired couple who kept giving me rides up the hill,
AAA towed us to San Angelo, TX, about an hour away.  But, alas, the tow ended up torqueing our camper jack to about
a 45 degree angle (the jack is the thing in the front that the camper stands on when stationary).  The tow truck driver was a good guy,
and spent about an hour plus, fixing it.  It's not vertical any more, but it held.  He also knocked $100 off the
tow since we will have to have it fixed properly some time soon.  He took us to a Walmart parking lot ---free
camping, food close by, free wifi, everything accessible by foot--- and then the truck to the Ford dealer.
<p>
  Unfortunately, the next afternoon we found out that it will take 3-4 days for the parts to arrive.  Groan.  After
  much effort (and stress), John found a truck we could rent to tow our camper to a nearby state park while
  we waited.  Even this didn't quite work out right as we ended up 10 miles from town, not a walkable 3.  But
  it was a nice park, providing a much needed opportunity to calm down and regroup.
<p>
  The parts ended taking only 2-3 days to arrive and the truck was fixed on Friday, instead of the following Tuesday
  that we had expected.  And we were off again!  Seriously this time though.  Long days in the truck.  But we made
  it to New Hampshire to beat the snow and get Katherine to her field trip, yay!  And in time to lose power for 36 hours ....

<p>
  This is all to say, that even when doing enjoyable things like visiting national parks or living in a camper,
  there are joys and setbacks all the time.  This trip really made me feel more `human' again.  Maybe it was the
  absence of COVID worries and strictures, and certainly it was being with John and Katherine (and Zara RIP)
  and Luna, and certainly it was because I had time away from UAF and its troubles.  I have found myself reflecting
  on the events of 2022 and looking
  forward to 2023 and the adventures and friends it will bring.  I hope that you too enjoy good holidays

 <strong>Happy Thanksgiving note: </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; November 21, 2022. &nbsp;&nbsp;

In place of the month 3 installment, I am sending greetings for a
Happy Thanksgiving.  I will post information about our trip in the
next weeks, I promise, but at the moment I mostly want to touch base
to send warm holiday greetings.
  </p>

Thanksgiving is not a holiday I particularly like, nor any Allman that
remembers that day on 1976, but it still is a time to reflect on
things that we are grateful for.  Last year we spent several most
enjoyable hours with our friends the Carlsons and Rozells (and the guy
who was recovering from bed bug bites).  I am going to miss that
comaraderie this year.

</p>

We are happily ensconced in Carrizozo, NM, a bit north of White Sands,
NM.  Of all the places we have visited, this is the place with the
absolutely most amazingly dark skies.  Mars is as red as we have ever
seen it, and Jupiter shines brilliantly.  The milky way is, well, a
milky path of stars, that makes you feel tremendously insignificant.
A couple at the last campground we stayed at told us about this State
Park (Valley of the Fires if you want to look it up).  It is alongside
a young lava flow, and near a BLM site with over 21,000 petroglyphs.
It is a very special place: quiet and remote and fascinating.

</p>

Something has turned in the last days, and all of us are starting to
be ready to head home (NH for the spring).  John and I want to get
more work done with more regular and easy internet, and Katherine is
looking forward to her bed and being in more regular contact with her
friends.  After the heat and relentless sun of CA, the cool nights
(and relentless sun) of the southwestern desert are welcome, but we
finally had a deep freeze last night which makes for less worry-free
camping.  The cold spell should pass soon fortunately.

</p>

Before heading east, the planned itinerary includes Guadalupe NP, El
Paso, Big Bend NP, and then a BIG 13th birthday celebration at an RV
park with a pool and internet and cell phone reception.  It is hard to
believe that Katherine will be a teenager.  (I won't mention the sass
... ;-) ) Then the long trip to NH begins and Xmas with my sister Mag.

</p>

I hope so much that your Thanksgivings are filled with good company
and good food.  This trip has made me appreciate how beautiful this
country we live in is, and also how many kind people reside here.  One
of the best parts of the trip is, after several years of suffering
through COVID and ugly politics, the restoration of faith that there
are a lot of kind

and interesting and helpful people about.

      <strong>Month 2: </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Olympic NP, Oregon Coast, Mt. St. Helens,
      Crater Lake, Lava Beds NM, Lassen NP ....
      Redwoods.

October 16, 2022: It is hard to believe that another month has passed
since leaving our house.  It has been a month filled with many
adventures, but also tremendous sadness.  Bad news first: We had to
put Zara to sleep on September 27 after a trip to the vet revealed
that she had cancer.  It was horrible.  The only consolations are that
we had 10 great years with her, and that she did not suffer.  Below
there is a picture of her from her early years, and one of her with
Katherine trying to make her feel good. She got some ice cream from DQ,
and lots of love and pats and rubs in her last days.  Loyal to the end
to John in particular, she left a hole in all our hearts.  Luna moped
for days, but found a ball in the Crater Lake campground that cheered
her and us all.

Our campground near Crater Lake was beautiful, near Thiessen Peak, the `lightening rod of the Cascades.'
Its unusual shape and tall height means it gets struck often by lightening.  Our (camping) neighbor
told a story of a Disney photographer staying at this campsite.  After a week's work taking photographs
for Disney at Crater Lake, he got caught in a thunder storm at the campground.  He set up two
cameras with telephoto lenses and laughed and laughed like a `crazy man' as he took hundeds of
photos of lightening striking the peak.  It is a remarkable peak, and an impressive view from
the campsite.  Nicest &quot;office view&quot I've ever had.

    On a human interest note, I'll mention how enjoyable it is to meet and talk with other campers.
Many are retired, ---few other families doing camper home-schooling now--- and many are living
in their RVs.  Indeed, living in an RV is so popular now, it can be hard to find an RV park
to stay in on the fly.  In thw town of Centralia, WA it was park number 4 that finally had
some space for us, and that was `overflow' camping (by the laundromat).  The majority of the
remainig RV park semi-permanent residents tend to be young-ish working males.  And, boy,
are the setups deluxe.  Many are easily 40 ft in length, and folks are clearly watching
big screen tv, streaming videos, taking showers in huge bathrooms, using their convection ovens, and
generally living quite comfortably.  Our Alaska plates always attract notice, and many
of the males have worked in AK, either in the military or as fishermen.  I'm getting ideas
for retirement ... though the miniature camper van is more my style.

The weather continues to be non-stop sunny and hot.  At times very
hot.  After becoming so attuned to the annual weather patterns in Alaska,
where it has snowed already this October, it is both very odd and very
cheering (for me).  Simply put, I love hot and sunny weather.  John suggested we
escape to the California coast this weekend (Redwoods NP and SP), and
the drive from 98 degrees and sunny was welcomed by John, and a bit
despressing for me.  The redwood trees are so tall that between the
  fog and the tree canopy it was dark in the camper by 4 pm.  Nonetheless,
  redwoods are amazing trees, resilient and ancient and beautiful.  This
park reminds me of my dear friend Eleanor, who since her wedding has
come here many times with her husband because she likes it so much.

	Katherine very much wanted me to include two highlights from
	the last month.  In addition to `junior ranger' programs, some
	of the parks have `Bark ranger' programs.  Luna was up to the
	task at Kalaloch in Olympic NP (on the ocean), promising to
	`stay on trails, always be on a leash, make sure she is picked
	up after, and other obligations.  John has commented
	repeatedly that `Luna has been promoted to top dog, despite
	her poor preparation for the job.'  :-) (He is as loyal to
	Zara as she was to him clearly.)  Luna is doing an excellent
	job!  <br />

  In a hot, dry, and somewhat god-forsaken part of northeastern
  California, a gigantic shield volcano Medicine Lake has had
  many small eruptions.  Lava oozed out and in the process of
  cooling created many lava tubes.  The park service has made
  many of them safe for self-guided tours.  With head lamps
  and at least 30 extra AAA batteries, we headed out for a 8.5 hour
  lava tube tour on our second day there.  Katherine absolutely
  loved it!  We squeezed through many particularly tight places,
  tubes whose height was only one foot tall in part, or longer
  two feet tall tubes.  Katherine was quick and nimble; her
  parents came out bruised and stiff.  Some passages 10 feet
  long might take John and me 45 minutes to get through.  I finally
  put my foot down at a particularly tight spot so we did not
  get to sign the register at the end of the cave to Katherine's
  great dismay.  (On the other hand, she did comment to John that
  "I'm not sure other people's parents would do this with their
  kids.")  We misread the map only once, and though I never
  thought we were not going to make it out, I did announce
  upon finally seeing daylight again that I would never
  take such a cave tour again.  No pictures to share, since
  it was all in the dark, but both John and I think this will
  be the highlight of all the parks for Katherine.

  <br /><br />
  Before starting to close, I include some pictures of one of my all-time
  favorite parks:  Crater Lake.  It is simply beautiful beyond
  words.  We had yet another glorious day there, and while
  John and Katherine ran off in embarrassment, I went swimming
  in my underclothes.  There was no way I was going to miss
  the opportunity to swim in Crater Lake.  No way! For those of you
  who knew me 20 or more years ago, I have also included a
  screen capture of a photo of John and me at Crater Lake
  back in 1999 when John drove me out to CA for my post-doc.
  We had brown hair, were wildly in love (or at least one of
  us), and had a most wonderful time at Crater Lake.  John
  still teases me of the 3000 pictures I took of the Phantom
  Ship, and this all before I owned a digital camera.

Friends and Family (hereafter known solely as friends):  &nbsp;&nbsp; As many of you know, our plan
for fall 2022 has been to take a long circuitious route through US National Parks on our
way to New Hampshire.  It is sabbatical year, and Katherine will be home schooling with
Dad in the fall (Mom would drive her crazy), and at seventh grade in New Hampshire in the spring.

We have been planning this for years, and after many a bump in the road before leaving (COVID,
Zara illness) we finally left Fairbanks on September 1.  We actually left our house on August
19th, but there were so many things to take care of, not the least of which was an emergency
trip from Denali NP to Fairbanks for Zara (she is fine now) that we finally left the state on
the first of September.

      Before our departure, my mind held opposing emotions:  excitement at the prospect of our
      imminent departure for a long-anticipated adventure, but also a sadness at leaving behind
      things that I love about Alaska ---friends, Katherine's friends and families,
      the boreal forest, the Equinox, a satisfying daily rhythm, my skis, our house, etc.
      Not since college have I left my home for one year's duration.

 	Indeed, with these thoughts in mind I thought I would try to write occasional
	letters to you all to keep in touch as we explore the lower 48.  My brother
	too asked for a map with destinations, so that he and his wife could keep
	track of us.  It will be easier to write one note, so please excuse the mass

  Our itinerary in a nutshell has been Denali NP (gotta start with the best!), through Canada
  along the Cassiar, crossing the border at Abbotsford, then North Cascades NP, Mt. Rainier
  NP, and now Olympic NP.  The weather has been truly magnificent, with smoke in North Cascades,
  but other than that picture-perfect.
  For Rich (brother), check out our route to the right.  I am writing this from Olympic NP,
  where we hope to stay for many days, decreasing the amount of driving at last.  Yesterday 
  we had a wonderful visit with a long-time friend from Maine who treated us
  to a lovely dinner in Tacoma, before heading out again.  I hope we get to see
  some of you too.  COVID has certainly made us rethink the important things in life,
  and having good friends and adventures is high on the list.

    The highlights for the first weeks for sure were BEARS!  BEARS!  BEARS! everywhere!
    Grizzlies in Denali NP (late August) and black bears and grizzlies in Canada.  At
    a campground in Canada, Meziadan Lake, as we were selecting a site, a grizzly
    walked through our first choice.  Then it hung out in the bushes near our second choice campsite,
    walked by several times, and was generally a bit reluctant to leave even as the
    campground hosts chased it in a truck and whooped at it.  Gotta love a campground
    when there are so many bears around (and you are safe in a camper).

     Katherine's favorite stop so far was Boya Lake on the Cassiar.  It was a gorgeous spot, and we rented a kayak
     and canoe to paddle around.  For me, I think Mt. Rainier has been the highlight, likely soon to be overtaken by
     Olympic NP.  The smoke around the North Cascades did not obscure the view too much, and the sun glowed orange
     as it set.  In one of the photos below, taken in Hope, BC (where we thought about Katherine's good friend), you can see
     a helicopter dropping water on a wildfire.  The campsite at Mt. Rainier was in old growth forest, and
     the lush feeling of the hundreds-year-old trees is calming and magnificent.  Katherine counted some
     rings on one downed trunk and we were reminded of her toddler counting:  &quot;One. Two. Three.
     A lot!&quot.  The volcano (Mt. Rainier) was hidden for the majority of      two days and then on our
     last afternoon there, as we started our hike, it came out.  And stayed out.  Just breathtaking.

     <br />
     As you can see, I am running out of steam so will let the photos tell the story.  Best wishes to all for
     the start of the school year, or for the start of the autumn.  Keep in touch. &nbsp; ---
